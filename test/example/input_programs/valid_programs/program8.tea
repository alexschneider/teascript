x := a or b

# and has higher precendence than or
y := c and d or e and f

# and is left associative
foo := a and b and c and d and e and f

## relational operators have higher
precedence than logical operators ##
bar := 1 <= 2 and 3 > 4 or 5 < 10
example := a is b or c isnt d

## arithmetic operators have higher
precendecne than relational operators ##
a := 1 + 5 > 9
b := 4 * 5 - 9 is 11

all_together := a / b + c >= d or e and f isnt false
